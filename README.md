# High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization
In this project I implement the following papers-
1. Batched High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization via Structural Kernel Learning (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/wang17h.html)
2. Discovering and Exploiting Additive Structure for Bayesian Optimization (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/gardner17a.html)
